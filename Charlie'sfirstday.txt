Today was my first day at dev boot camp.  I am completely new to this. What do they say? "Wet behind the ears." 
It seems that everyone in my class has more experience than I when it comes to computers.  I am coming at this with 
little to no experience and that scares me greatly, making me think, 'am I supposed to have experience before coming into this?'
But it the camp did state that there was no experience necessary, so I don't know. Things are moving fast and I feel like I am 
standing still.  Let's see if this camp gets any easier for me----time will tell.  Another thought just popped in to my head, 
perhaps I will look back on this entry, and all the entries for the first week, and laugh at my ignorance; I hope so.
