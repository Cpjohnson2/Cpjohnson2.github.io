But I feel like I am learning<br/>regardless of whether I want to bang my head on the table with force. </br>  Today I, (we) learned boolean operators, which is applying<br/>logic statements to Python, and string Formatting (which is very important, especially when it comes to syntax).We touched upon<br/>if/else statements.  I'm a little frightened of the lists, as there is a lot to remember.  We also wrote code for a dice game that<br/>we wrote rules for, although we did not finish this program, I felt it a little daunting and it seemed like it's going over my head.<br/>Our all on your own lab consisted of arrays and arranging the integers so that they came out true or if asked to, came out false. <br/>I also feel like I have to do some personal work in order to \"catch up\" with the others around here, I feel like an anchor at sea. <br/>Hopefully, like I wrote yesterday, this feeling of inadequacy and confusion will eventually wash away."

I honestly feel better than yesterday and the day before,<br/>my first day.  </br> I still think that there is a lot of work that I need to put in, and determination especially determination!. <br/>Today we worked on our third on your own lab, which consisted of arrays, making sure that the arrays were true, and also <br/>learning how to rotate the arrays so the numbers are in a certain order.  I can only hope that things go smoother from here on out."

		"text": "Things are a bit clearer, but still as confusing as hell.  Today we went over our dice game, and applied loops; aka: the while function to our dice game so that we can continue to play our game after the first game. We also learned about loops. <br/> I was paired today with the strongest programmer in our class and found that I learn the best with people that know what I don't, which at this point is A LOT. I know that it/s good everyone/s learning if there is a teacher/pupil model. I am still VERY lost at this and I continue to have this sinking feeling that I may not be cut out for computer programming.  Will Time tell?  That is the ultimate question at this point."

		"text": "Today was certainly the best day of the week.  I had a little pow wow with myself last night and realized that the way to truly understand python is to sit there, no matter how long it takes, and figure it out.  Google, ask friends that have programming experience, watch videos, etc.  The learning method for computer programming is very unique, and being a person that comes from a typical classroom environment, this learning process will take some getting used to.  I am behind in the class, and I have to be fine with that.  I have to sit down by myself, especially this weekend and bang my head against the wall until I start to understand this and catch up."

		"text" :  "Absolutely the best day I've had so far.  I have to remind myself that this is like learning a foreign language, and that it's impossible to pick it up as if it were a simple hobby.  Today we were delegated two projects, a personal one and a team based project.  The personal project is one that I am developing for my 4 year old son; it's a story masher.  For clarification sake, what my program will, hopefully, do is take two stories: Star Wars and Teeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and mash them into one story, or universe if you will.  So, my son will give me a hero from both stories and a villain from both stories, these characters will be entwined into each others respective story, meaning that I will have to replace character names.  The second project, our group project is a project that will find the trending hashtags on twitter in four major metropolitan areas, S.F., LA, Chicago, NY, and have those hashtags analysed.  And then we can turn around with the analysis that we have gleaned, and use those numbers to create our own trending hashtag.  I am still pretty confused and green, but with enough time and patience, one can learn almost anything.  It has to get better from here, right?"

		"text" : "Wow! I wrote my first program, albeit VERY slowly and with tons of help, but I did it regardless.  It took me all day to complete, but I kept my head up and went forward, even if I felt like giving up a few times; persistence is key.  I can NOT wait to sit down with my son and try this program with him. I think he'll be impressed.  I know I am impressed with myself!  I assume that computer coding is definitely an industry in which there are a lot of highs and lows, yet when the highs hit, they certainly hit!  Now, don't get me wrong.  Is there still a lot of work and understanding on my part to do? Yes. But everyday things become incrementally clearer. I hope this trend doesn't stop."

		 "text" : "Well, the days keep getting better here.  I am really starting to get a good groove when it comes to python. the labs that are provided are challenging, but once I find out the solution to them, I not only feel jubilant, but confident in understanding how I got to that solution.  Learning computer programming is taking it step by step.  I think where my weakness in learning programming is trying to learn too much at once; I need to slow down and take it piecemeal. It is impossible to know everything, but it is not impossible to learn anything. Today was a great day for me, I am certainly making progress, and that feels great."

		 "title": "Ninth Day",
		 "text": "Today was a tough day for me.  When I went home last night I was filled with a sense of confidence and understanding with Python.  Upon entering the program this morning all of that confidence was eradicated, and the knowledge I thought I had was inapplicable.  After feeling lost and confused for most of the morning, I forced myself to tackle the things that frightened me, due to my ignorance with Python, and I have to say, it worked.  My method was not to look at the problem as a big problem, but as a series of small ones that just happen to make a large one.  I have to continue to remind myself that code is written line by line, and therefore learning it should be line by line. It's starting to become clearer to me, but it hasn't clicked yet, like it has for others.  I hope it clicks soon."

		 "text": "Today I presented my personal project, which is a story masher for my four year old son.  Essentially it takes stories from two universes; Star Wars and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and takes the main characters (the heroes and villains) and mashes them together so that they can coexist in the same universe.  Right now my project is functional, but it is not where I want it to be, so I need to tweak some things in order for it to be ideal.  I was very nervous when presenting, mainly because I have never presented on a computer program before, much less one that I wrote!  However, after I completed my presentation I realized just how far I have come within these two weeks.  The things that I am understanding and doing today, are things that would have been out of my league two weeks ago.  So progress is definitely being made, whether I feel it sometimes or not; progress is being made.  Our group project went well.  We designed a program to track the most popular hash tags in twitter from 4 major cities: LA, Chicago, SF, and NYC.  We then analysed that data and put that data into a few pie charts, it was definitely cool to see the finished product.  I feel that not only has my confidence increased in programming these last two weeks, but my feeling of being frightened by the material has abated as well. I am excited to see what lays in store for me next."

		 "text": "With a lot of help from others, I was finally able to finish my personal project to my ideal vision.  I parsed the text files so that it only prints 200 words of the story now, instead of the whole story at once.  This amendment to my personal program took me 6 hours.  I think that to a trained programmer, that would have taken them about 10 minutes max. We had a coding challenge in which we constructed the high/low game from scratch.  I think I was the only one in my class that did NOT finish the project.  I think that at this juncture of the program I should be able to write that game in about a half hour, but where I'm at in my personal experience level, I would be lucky to even create finish a game like that, much less in a half hour.  My skill level is certainly the lowest of the class and it shows, quite clearly.  One thing to note about the high/low game is that when I write it out, in english, I actually have the game.  However, when I sit down to translate that pseudo code to python, I can't.  I just can't.  Perhaps this isn't for me."

		 "text": "Today was my python evaluation and I passed.  Yes, I am just as surprised as you are.  Or, maybe I'm not.  I went in there, was asked some technical questions about Python, stood there and thought for a bit, and then information that I believe was latent and buried deep in my mind started to come forth and I was finding myself applying what I have learned about in python to the questions being asked.  I couldn't believe it.  These past two weeks have been very challenging for me and it has put me in the position of self doubt in my abilities.  But I have to trust in myself; to trust that I am getting this, and that I have already applied what I have learned.  I can and will do this!  Never give up!"

		 "text": "Today, we had a crash course in HTML.  My experience with HTML so far has been a good one.  I find that I can read and write in HTML a lot easier than I ever did with Python.    I finished all 3 of my labs today, which is a first for me.  I also found that when I ran into an obstacle in HTML during my labs, it was easier to surmount the issues that I faced in HTML than with Python.  With that being said, I feel like the fundamental knowledge that I gleaned from the past two weeks with Python were being applied in my learning of HTML.   Does this mean that it gets easier?   This early stage of understanding HTML is exciting for me, and very promising for what JS/HTML has in store for me in the future.  "

		 "text": "The last day of April and the first day of learning Java Script.  I feel like my confidence level with programming is higher than it ever has been before.  The fundamentals that I learned in Python are beginning to come in handy, which makes JS a lot easier to understand the first time around.  I feel like I have a stronger command over the labs, and when I run into an issue with my labs, I tend to figure out the answer by myself, with little to no help from the instructors.  So here's to confidence; may it continue to grow!"

I am still trying to wrap my head around that last lab, I think some homework is in store for me this weekend.  This has certainly been my best week since I began here, with out a doubt.  We had two coding challenges on multiple dimension arrays, and I finished both of them!  A big step from where I was two weeks ago.  I look forward to delving even deeper into the JS curriculum next week.  My fear with computer programming is beginning to be washed away by my confidence--- let this trend continue!"

		"text": "May the Fourth be with you!  Today we learned some more HTML and JQUERY.   We had 2 labs which dealt directly with HTML, and JQuery.  I find all of our labs extremely useful and applicable.  Java Script is another beast for sure; with the CSS, HTML, and JS, it seems like you need to make sure that all your ducks are in a row before executing properly.  I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Python right now, for that very reason.  Tomorrow, I will delve into the two projects that were assigned by Nick.  The first project has to do with submitting information into a website and validating the information, and the second project is measuring a concrete block.  I look forward to completing these two projects with what I have already learned in JS."

		"text": "Well, what to say, other than today was a tough day for me in regards to good ol' Java Script.  I am very close to finishing the first project; the validation project.  I have most of my code set and running, but I need a couple of tweaks to really make it functional.  I haven't even started on the second project, but I am still ahead of the curve, so there is time.   The projects that they gave us may be difficult, but what we are learning from them is invaluable.  Hopefully tomorrow goes a little smoother....we shall see. "

		"text": "Today I have decided to not blog about my confusion with computer programming, or my struggles with it. No, today I am going to touch on a couple of things that I have accomplished during my 3 weeks here.  The first thing being the TwitBot.  The first day here, we were introduced to the Twitter API and we were instructed to create a twitter bot that basically replies to the top hash tag of the day. My twitterbot basically says: 'Look out! Darth Vader is standing right behind you,' to anyone that twitted the top hash tag of the day; needless to say, I have been confusing a lot of people on twitter.  The second project I'd like to talk about it my personal project using the Python Language.  My project was intended for my son.  He loves when I tell him Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle stories, and Star Wars stories.  Well, my storytelling ability has a limit, and so I thought that developing a program that would output not only Star Wars stories and TMNT stories, but it will take characters from both worlds and mash them together so they all live in the same universe.  This is when I realized that a big part of software development is creating programs that makes life a little easier; and my program does that for me."

		"text": "I feel like I am understanding about 50% of JavaScript right now.  this 50% understanding of JS certainly reflects in my projects, which are basically 50% done.  I just can't seem to finish the projects to completion.  It's as if I go along with the JavaScript projects with confidence and aplomb, but that feeling quickly gets dashed when I run into a road block.  The road blocks in JS are much tougher to surmount than when I ran into them in Python.  All I know is that the key to coding is persistence and with enough persistence comes understanding; so I need to be VERY persistent "

I need to really comprehend the fundamentals of how to calculate dimensions using JavaScript, because if I can get that down, I can complete the second project.  Oh, that reminds me that I completed the first project....finally.  To jog your memory, the project was a submission form that we needed to create using JS.  Well, after a long, agonizing process I did it.  I am really proud of my own personal progress.  Now onto the weekend, time to catch up, enjoy the weather, enjoy my family, and celebrate mother's day!"

		"text":"OK, so I have good news and I have some bad news.  The good news is that over the weekend I dreamt in code.  In fact, I woke up, partly asleep, mumbled something to my wife along the lines of: 'I'm ready to validate', and after uttering this to her, I apparently laid back down and went right back to sleep.  I keep hearing an interesting fact about learning a new language, it's that if you end up dreaming in the language that you are learning it means that you are absorbing at least some of it.  So I was obviously feeling pretty good after waking up and only remembering dreams in which I was coding.  But, here comes the bad news.  After my code heavy dreams I found myself coming into class this morning with a new found sense of confidence only to have it wither away when I was trying to figure out the construction project.  This is obviously very frustrating, and I've run into this problem at least a few times while learning computer coding; that is, whenever I feel like I have a strong hold on the concepts of the languages that we are learning, I almost immediately get humbled by realizing how much I don't know. I wonder how long this goes on for.... When will it 'click' for me, like it's 'clicking' for everyone else in the class.  I've said before, and I'll say it again right now; I hope it clicks soon, because this is getting old."

Today I pulled all the necessary data from college and NFL football sites, converted them into CSV files, and then converted the CSV files into JSON files.  After storing all this great, and very necessary data, the fun really begins; now I need to work out some algorithms that will decide, for the user, what the best rookie is to draft for their fantasy team.   I like this project a lot, because it combines two passions of mine: sports and software development.  I think the mountain (data) has been conquered, it's just getting down the mountain now that matters, and sometimes that's the most treacherous part.  We'll see how tomorrow goes- hopefully I write some really great functions!"

I realized that mistake when I started to weigh my variables and noticed that not all the variables are there, so today I had to take a step backward before I take a step forward.  I also ran into the problem of not converting my CSV files correctly into JSON, so that also took some time out of my day.

Today we also had a review of our exam, which is on Monday, and I feel like I will do a pretty good job on it, but I will use the weekend to brush up on some things to better my overall score.  It's a weird thing in computer programming; when things look virtually impossible on a Monday, and by Friday you find yourself actually doing the thing that you found impossible on a Monday.  And that is one of the biggest realization that I have since learning computer programming: that the only thing that limits you in computer programming is a persons imagination."

I liked presenting the website portion of it, and I also found that when I was explaining my source code, I was presenting it a lot smoother than when I was presenting my Python source code for my personal project in Python.  I am still a little nervous for the more formal presentation that we have on the 27th of May in front of the senior web developers, but I have some time to get acquainted with my website and my code, so I should be ok.  Post presentations we dove right into C#.  We have done a few rudimentary labs on C#, think Hello World.  But I know that by tomorrow we will be undertaking concepts that will be much more difficult than anything that we did today.  I am personally looking forward to staying on ONE language for the rest of the time here in the program (1.5 months), I find that jumping from language to language can often be jarring, but it does make for a well rounded student I guess; so there is a method to the madness here."

		"text": "Today, was definitely one of my better days in the program.  I am absolutely loving Visual Studio (thank you MS!), and C#.  I don't know if I am understanding it because I have two language concepts under my belt, or if it is just clicking for me.  I hope it's a mixture of both, with emphasis on the latter. I finished all the labs that were provided and I really feel like I am absorbing the information in a much more direct manner. I truly think that it might have taken my brain, which is a liberal arts brain - a month and a half to get going and take in the course material, absorb it and then execute on what I've learned.  Of course tomorrow's blog post could be very opposite from this one, so time will tell, but I hope that it just keeps getting better from here on out.  C# you had me at hello. "

For what might have taken me an hour or so in python labs, in the beginning of the program, is now taking about half that time (30 minutes), with C#.  I think that anyone that says that learning computer programming is akin to learning an instrument or learning a sport, is not far off.  At first programming, and really anything new that you want to learn, that has a considerable learning curve, looks intimating, like there is no way in hell that you will retain all the information that is given to you, much less execute on it, but with enough time, persistence, patience, and practice you can get it...you can execute, maybe not at a pro level (yet), but you can play a few chords, swim a couple of laps, or write a couple of programs---and that is progress my dear friends.

The second thing that I did today was a coding challenge that was writing a reverse hi-lo game in C#.  The writing of Hi-Lo definitely through me for a loop, I wrote a regular Hi-Lo game, but when it's reversed, and the computer has to pick a number, it becomes something altogether different.  When writing the program, I needed to figure out two main things; one, how a computer picks a number, and the second method was how to have the computer wait a set amount of time after making a selection. After a few hours, and some help from my instructor and a classmate I finally wrote the Hi-Lo program to an executable game that worked!  Tomorrow, we dive into methods in C# and method overloading, so it should be a good learning experience."

The labs that are created here are really useful, as they are not only educational, but when we are assigned a project, whether it's collaborative or personal, the labs always factor in as a good reference point.

It's hard to believe that I am already half way through, and what's funny is that my brain feels 50% complete when it comes to wrapping my head around computer programming.  What I am absorbing in this program is effecting me greatly; whenever any one talks I am putting their speech into functions- if/else statements, also when I dream now, almost ever dream has something to do with coding, whether it's me reading it on a screen, writing it, or talking about; coding is the main theme of my life this past month and a half.  I never thought I would be able to think this way; an analytical, logical, problem solving way of thinking, it's pretty crazy.  Back to the routine though, today I presented my JavaScript project again, another dress rehearsal.  I'm overall pretty happy with my website, although I feel like it lacks a WOW factor, and it does, but it is something that I can change with enough time and research, I have to be a little bit more patient with myself.  I also have to remind myself that I didn't think I was going to be capable of building a website in a couple of weeks,  much less in 3 months!"

The thing that makes MVC hard is that there isn't much on Google for MVC5, but I actually found that struggling through it is important for sharpening my development skills.
